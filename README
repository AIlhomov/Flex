fb2-4.l: Creates a text concordance by identifying where words are used in a 
    file and the line number where they are used. Basically tells the most important words skipping
    common words like "the", "an" and so on.

fb2-5.l: Helps analyze C code by identifying where variables, functions, 
    and other identifiers are defined and referenced.

    Example:
    calculateArea (defined at geometry.c:12)
    x (defined at geometry.c:8, used at geometry.c:15, geometry.c:20)
